## _Instruction_
•	The application is a sentiment analysis application, which, given a piece of text, should be able to reply with its sentiment as being positive, negative, or neutral.  
•	The text language used must be English  
•	The application should have a web interface with an input form and a submit button, where users can input their sentences, and hit submit, and the sentiment of their sentence will be presented.  
•	The accuracy of the sentiment analyzer should be above 80%  
•	The application must be easily deployable  

## The dataset used for the model is the Twitter US airline sentiment available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)
